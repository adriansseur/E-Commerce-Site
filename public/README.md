# Portfolio Project: E-Commerce-Site

This project is included in my portfolio (adriansseur.github.io) because it both shows my ability to build a full webpage and gives an example of a highly desirable type of website which is e-commerce.

## Motivation

I chose to build an online store because it was new to me and having to manage a cart seemed like an interesting challenge. My family also needs this website so perhaps they decide to actually use it.

## Description

Built with React. Using hooks like useState and useEffect. Using React Router. Added a little Typescript. Using it to better understand the difference between using version control through VS Code and running npm run deploy.

This site is currently under development.
